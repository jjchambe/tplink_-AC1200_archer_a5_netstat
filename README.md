# tplink_-AC1200_archer_a5_netstat

With a slow DSL connection and >15 wifi devices, we had a hard time figuring out which device was the bandwidth hog during working and schooling from home.  This was written to run on a Win10 box with a mix of python and commandline parsing (read hacking).

It works well as a scheduled task running every 2 minutes to give us a snapshot of where out bandwidth is going.

It is sloppy.  It is hacky.  But it works for us and thought someone else might use it or improve it.
