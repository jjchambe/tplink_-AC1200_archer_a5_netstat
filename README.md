# tplink_-AC1200_archer_a5_netstat

With a slow DSL connection and >15 wifi devices, we had a hard time figuring out which device was the bandwidth hog during working and schooling from home.  This was written to run on a Win10 box with a mix of python and commandline parsing of files.

It works well as a scheduled task running every 2 minutes to give us a snapshot of where our bandwidth is going.  Our hardware is a TP-Link AC1200 Archer A5 router as is out of the box.

It is sloppy.  It is hacky.  But it works for us and thought someone else might use it or improve it.
